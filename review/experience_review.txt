Our experience with our customers was simple and straightforward. Our customers didn't have any
questions and the one changed they asked for was a few periods for the style.

Our experience with our providers was nice. We had a lot of questions about their code and they were
usually quick to respond and nice to work with. We learned not to write the code the way they wrote
theirs. While their code was difficult to work with the developers of the code were a pleasure to
work with.

We could have used keyframes instead of transitions from the start which would have been a bit
easier to work with.
