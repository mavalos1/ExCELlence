Design critique:

Controller is lacking in functionality. The controller should do more than just start the animation
and set the tickrate. The view contains a lot of the functionality that should be in the controller.

Also both the view and the controller have a function to set the ticks per
second. Only one of these should be needed (preferably in the controller).

Their shapes do not have names so we have to keep track of this manually in our model.


Implementation critique:

Many functions that should be defined in interfaces are not. Please revise functions used in
implementations and make sure all relevant functions are included in their interfaces.


Documentation critique:

Documentation is acceptable.


Design/code limitations:

Unable to add keyframes with initial values in the editor view. All keyframes must be added with
default values and then edited separately. This could be improved by adding additional fields to the
view to specify initial values for the keyframes.


Other notes:

We had to change the name of our position 2d get X and Y functions since they had the same name as
our provider's.
